# Fileless Malware Techniques detection rules
Threat Hunting rules related to the fileless malware techniques presented in the conference AsturCON 2023 in Oviedo. These rules are aimed to be used in EDRs, but do not use any EDR language in particular so as to avoid technology dependence. They are written in pseudocode and can be easily translated to any EDR language in order to be used.
